    <h1>Simple Lists</h1>
    <p>
      The simplest way to render a list is with an Item View. It might seem strange to use an Item View
      to render a list, as opposed to a Collection or Composite View, but there <em>are</em> times when
      you don't need the added functionality that those views give you.
    </p>

    <h2>When To Use</h2>
    <p>
      You should use Item Views to render your lists when you don't need to track events, like hovers
      or clicks, on individual items in the list. When you need to track events you should look into one
      of those other view classes.
    </p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
      The following mark up is rendered by the code found in <code>simple-list.js</code>:
    </p>
    <ul class='list'></ul>
